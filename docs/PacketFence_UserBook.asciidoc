About this Guide
----------------

This guide will walk you through the configuration of policies, from a simple example to something complex.

The instructions are based on version {release_version} of PacketFence.

The latest version of this guide is available online at http://www.packetfence.org/documentation/guides.html

Assumptions
^^^^^^^^^^^

 * You have a PacketFence installed and went through the configurator.
 * You are using a VLAN enforcement of WebAuth type of installation.
 * Your PacketFence is up and running, `Management` interface is reachable from your network equipement (Wireless controller/switches).
 * There is no firewall in between your network equipements and PacketFence that could block 1700, 1812, 1813, 3799.


Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The UserBook is here to help you understand on how to configure your PacketFence for your need. This guid will explain to you how to configure simple setup and diffreent action to complexify in the purpose to go to your final objective.

Remember that simple is not easy, it does just require less time to configure and debug aftewards.

Wi-Fi public
^^^^^^^^^^^^

To kick off we will configure two SSID, including a Public SSID (Open with MAC authentication and a portal login using PacketFence local users source, LDAP or SMS).

Open SSID
~~~~~~~~~

First of all you need to make sure the following are defined:
 * Wireless controller from which the request will come, in the section `Networks->Switches`.
 * Local source, sms source and LDAP source in the section `Users->Sources`.

We will start by configuring a Portal Profile related to this SSID.

Click on the section `Main->Portal Profiles`, now click `Add profile`.

In your Portal profile, define a Name and description. Add a filter using the condition SSID: `PF-Open`. Add your sources and save.

From now on, every one connecting from the SSID `PF-Open` will be landing on the portal define by this portal profile.

You have some options under the tab `Captive Portal` where you can add your logo company, and a redirection URL or the different languages in which the page will be available for instance. Have a look through those options.
